### Hi, I'm a graduate student who likes cats.
The cat is so cute.
There are many advantages.
First of all, it's not too loud, 
it' s too nice to wander the tail, and the jump is too good.
The hair of the cat is also soft.
I can not raise cats because I have allergies, 
but I would be happy to see cats in cat cafes once a month.

I also think that coffee is essential for graduate students.
When I worked at a company, I had two cups a day, but I drink three cups. 
I still drink cafe latte for my body though. 
The cafe latte is really good, it is soft, I do not have a favorite brand, 
I just use Seoul milk and it looks delicious! 
Seoul milk contains little sodium but it is delicious.

Thank you, I love you!

See you again!
